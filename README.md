# Daily Workout

A simple workout generator for when you're travelling, have little time, or just wanna try something different.

Workouts are structured in circuits of lower body/push/pull/core exercises for 5 to 30 minutes. Do as many repetitions as you can for each exercise before moving on.

Most exercises are doable on any fitness level without any equipment. Additional equipment unlocks a some additional exercises. If you're unsure how to do an exercise, clicking on it opens youtube instructions.

I started working on it on a long train ride just to occupy myself.
